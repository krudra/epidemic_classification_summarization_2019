How to run: python extract-symptoms-from-dep-parser.py

Note:
1. All the inputs are hard-coded. Following things need to be taken care of.

2. basepath_1 = "Tweebo-Parser-Input/Symptoms" should contain files like sample_input.txt

3. basepath = "Tweebo-Parser-Output/Symptoms" should contain files like sample_output.txt (one-to-one correspondence with sample_input.txt)
